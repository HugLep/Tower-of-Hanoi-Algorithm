The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical logic game invented by French mathematician √âdouard Lucas in 1883. The goal is to move a stack of disks, each with a unique diameter, from a starting base to an intermediate base, while respecting certain precise rules. This puzzle is often used to teach the principles of recursion in computer science and problem-solving strategies.

### Rules of the Game

**Three bases and several disks:**
- The starting configuration has three bases or rods, and several disks stacked from largest to smallest on the starting base.

**But:**
- Move the entire stack of disks from the starting base to the destination base.

**Constraints:**
- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- No disk can be placed on a smaller disk.

### Recursion Principle

Solving the Tower of Hanoi relies on recursion, a method where a complete solution is constructed by solving several similar subproblems. Here is how it works: Splitting the problem: Consider moving ùëõ n disks from the starting base to the destination base.

Recursive steps:
- Move the ùëõ ‚àí 1 disks from the starting base to the intermediate base.
- Move the largest disk directly to the destination base.
- Move the ùëõ ‚àí 1 disks from the intermediate base to the destination base.

### Solving Strategy

The number of moves needed to solve a Tower of Hanoi with ùëõ disks is 2^ùëõ ‚àí 1. For example, for three disks, it will take at least 7 moves. This formula highlights the rapid growth of the complexity of the game with the increase in the number of disks, each addition of disk doubling the number of moves required.

### Applications and Uses

Beyond entertainment, the Tower of Hanoi is used in computer science to illustrate concepts such as recursion and algorithmic complexity. It also serves as a model for understanding data structures and process management, especially in situations requiring strict ordering.
